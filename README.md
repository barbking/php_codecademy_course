Intro to PHP through codecademy

PHP can:
* Talk to databases
* Send cookies
* Evaluate form data
* Build dynamic webpages

Instead of index.html, use index.php to tell interpreter there is php code to evaluate

The <?php and ?> tags tell the Web server to treat everything inside the tags as PHP code to run. (Everything outside these tags is sent straight to the browser as-is.)

Need to put a semicolon after each line of code in your PHP scripts, unless only one line of code.

$array = array()  //access by $array(i) or $array{i}
