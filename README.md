Intro to PHP through codecademy

PHP can:
* Talk to databases
* Send cookies
* Evaluate form data
* Build dynamic webpages

Instead of index.html, use index.php to tell interpreter there is php code to evaluate

The <?php and ?> tags tell the Web server to treat everything inside the tags as PHP code to run. (Everything outside these tags is sent straight to the browser as-is.)

Echo or print to display

Need to put a semicolon after each line of code in your PHP scripts, unless only one line of code.
### PHP Functions
$array = array()  //access by $array(i) or $array{i}
array(), array_push(), sort(), count(), rand(), strtoupper(), strtolower(), strlen(),

### PHP Objects
PHP objects are instances of classes.  Almost everything is an object in PHP.  Object-Oriented PHP helps your code stay flexible by allowing it to be only defined once but used in many places.
- is_a(), use to find out if a particular object is an instance of a given class;
- property_exists(), to see if an object has a given property; and method_exists()
Inheritance - way for one class to take on the properties or methods of another class.  Expresses "is-a" relationship.  Use extend keyword.
